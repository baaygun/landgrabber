# Landgrabber

QoL improvements for landgrab.net

# Feature Set

## Show All Borders

Adds a checkbox on the left sidebar to render all border connections at the same time.

# Installation

Extension will automatically inject the content script to correct landgrab pages, and won't work in any other webpage.

Currently, it only works on Firefox, Chrome extension security, injection is a lot more different and I use Firefox as my main browser.
